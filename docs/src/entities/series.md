# Series

Series allows you to organize your book series or publications.

For example, you could choose to create series for a franchise as a whole,
such as _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, and including all editions published
inside it, or creating a series for each edition, such as
_Neon Genesis Evangelion [Collector's Edition]_.

For example, you could choose to group your books by its type, by creating
collections such as _Manga_, _Light novels_, or _Comics_; although
this is just a suggestion.

A book can only be part of a single series, so choose wisely what criteria
you will be using to create your library series.

If you also want to categorize a book by multiple criteria, [Tags] are
meant for this usage.

option to specify if the alternative name is romanized or not.

## Edit a series

To edit a series, open the series page by clicking on the three dots
button in the series table and then click on **Edit**. Similar to
the creation, you will be asked to edit the same information in
the same form. When you're done, click on **Save** to finish the process.

## Delete a series

To delete a series, open the series page by clicking on the three
dots button in the series table and then click on **Delete**.

:::info
Deleting a series **will not** delete the books inside it. The books
that were part of it will have the series field marked as _Unknown_.

This is by design, since there's cases where books doesn't have a
series or don't need to be grouped inside one, such as one-shot manga.
