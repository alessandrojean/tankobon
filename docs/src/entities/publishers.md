# Publishers

Publishers allows you to manage the publishing companies.

Although the original intention of the entity is to represent a
company as a whole, such as _Kodansha_, you can opt to create
a publisher entry for each imprint, such as _Vertical_.

A book can have multiple publishers, as there's some cases where
two or more publishers does a partnership to release a particular
book or series, although it's not that common.

## Creating a publisher

Publishers can be created on the **Publishers** section on the sidebar.
Click on **New publisher** and fill the requested information in the
page, such as the _name_ and _description_. When you're done,
click on **Create** to finish the process. You will then be redirected
to the publisher page.

books that were part of it will have the publisher field empty.

When you edit the book again, you will be asked to fill the publisher field.
