# Stores

Stores allows you to manage the bookstores.

Each book can be marked as bought in a store, where you can
also specify the _bought at_, _billed at_ and _arrived at_ date
in the same section.

## Creating a store

Stores can be created on the **Stores** section on the sidebar.
Click on **New store** and fill the requested information in the
page, such as the _name_ and _description_. When you're done,
click on **Create** to finish the process. You will then be redirected
to the store page.

### External links

In this tab you can provide some predetermined external links about the
store. The series supports external links for: Website,
[Twitter], [Instagram], [Facebook] and [YouTube].

### Picture

In this tab you can select a image to be uploaded and used as the
store picture. It will be displayed in the store page and in the
stores table while browsing through the library stores.

You can upload an image of any aspect ratio and size, although
the supported formats are `BMP`, `JPEG`, `PNG` and `WEBP`,
limited to a maximum file size of 5MB.

## Edit a store

To edit a store, open the store page by clicking on the three dots
button in the store table and then click on **Edit**. Similar to
the creation, you will be asked to edit the same information in
the same form. When you're done, click on **Save** to finish the process.

## Delete a store

To delete a store, open the store page by clicking on the three
dots button in the store table and then click on **Delete**.

:::info
Deleting a store **will not** delete the books marked as bought there.
The books will have the store field marked as _Unknown_.

This is by design, as there's some cases you might not remember
where you have bought the book or could have received it as a gift,
therefore not having a store to link.
