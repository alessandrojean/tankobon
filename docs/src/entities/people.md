# People

worked on a particular book.

You can have authors, artists, letterers, translators and many
other in your library. You will be able to link what each person
have done in each book during book creation/edition.

To edit a person, open the person page by clicking on the three dots
button in the people table and then click on **Edit**. Similar to

the same form. When you're done, click on **Save** to finish the process.

## Delete a person

To delete a person, open the person page by clicking on the three

:::info
Deleting a person **will not** delete the books where it was a
contributor. The contributor entry for the person will be removed
from the book contributors list.

There could be some cases where the book ends with no contributors.
When you edit these books again, you will be asked to provide
at least one contributor.
