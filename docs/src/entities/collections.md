# Collections

Collections allows you to organize your library by groups of any kind.

For example, you could choose to group your books by its type, by creating
collections such as _Manga_, _Light novels_, or _Comics_; although
this is just a suggestion.

A book can only be part of a single collection, so choose wisely what criteria
you will be using to create your library collections.

If you also want to categorize a book by multiple criteria, [Tags] are
meant for this usage.

## Creating a collection

Collections can be created on the **Collections** section on the sidebar.
Click on **New collection** and fill the requested information in the
dialog, such as the _name_ and _description_. When you're done,
click on **Create** to finish the process. You will then be redirected
to the collection page.

## Edit a collection

To edit a collection, open the collection page by clicking on the three dots
button in the collections table and then click on **Edit**. Similar to
the creation, you will be asked to edit the same information, _name_
and _description_. When you're done, click on **Save** to finish
the process.
