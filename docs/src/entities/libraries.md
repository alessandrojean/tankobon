# Libraries

Libraries allows you to manage a personal book collection. It's the
_super_ entity where all your books, collections, series,
publishers, stores and so on will be grouped.

Multiple libraries can be created per user, so that will allow you
to manage multiple collections in different places, for example.

You can also share a library with another user, so it will have access
to view and manage your books as well, which can be useful in the use
case of book collections that belongs to multiple people.

## Creating a library

Libraries can be created on the **Libraries** section on the sidebar.
Click on **New library** and fill the requested information in the
dialog, such as the _name_ and _description_. When you're done,
click on **Create** to finish the process. You will then be redirected
to the library page.
