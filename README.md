     ```
  2. Start a Docker container in detached mode.

     ```
     $ docker run -d \

### `/server`

The core Spring Boot backend that powers up Tankobon.

### `/client`

The standard Vue.js web client that consumes the API.

## Acknowledgements

[Komga] project structure is the main inspiration for the Tankobon
code structure. Although it's a self-hosted tool with a different
purpose, it's definetely worth taking a look into it.
