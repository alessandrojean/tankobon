## Getting started

Tankobon isn't ready for normal usage yet. For now, you can follow the
[Contributing] section to build from source and run locally or try a
nightly Docker image build.

### Running through Docker

The nightly images are available in [GitHub Packages]. You can run
manually by using the `docker` command or by using [Docker Compose].

  <summary>Command-line instructions</summary>

  1. Pull the Docker image from GitHub Packages.

     ```console
     $ docker pull ghcr.io/alessandrojean/tankobon:{tag}
     ```

     Make sure to replace `{tag}` in the command with the latest
     image tag version, available at the [Github Packages] page.
  2. Start a Docker container in detached mode.

     ```console
     $ docker run -d -p 25565:8080 ghcr.io/alessandrojean/tankobon:{tag}
     ```
  3. Open http://localhost:25565 on a browser and proceed with the claim setup
     to create the first administrator user.

<details>
  <summary>Docker Compose instructions</summary>

  Using a Docker Compose file such as the example provided below will
  allow you to change additional settings such as mapping volumes to
  have access to the database if needed.

  1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file.

     ```yaml
     version: '3.9'
     services:
       tankobon:
         image: ghcr.io/alessandrojean/tankobon:{tag}
         ports:
           - '25565:8080'
         volumes:
           - /path/to/user_home/.tankobon:/root/.tankobon
     ```
  2. Start a Docker container in detached mode.

     ```console
     $ docker-compose up -d
     ```
  3. Open http://localhost:25565 on a browser and proceed with the claim setup
     to create the first administrator user.

## Contributing

Contributions are very **welcome**! Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md]
guide before getting started.

A quick summary of the steps required to get going:

1. Install [pnpm], [Node.js] and [JDK 17].
2. Run the server:

   ```console
   $ ./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev,localdb'
   ```
3. Run the client:

   ```console
   $ pnpm dev
   ```

And that's it! Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) in a browser
and follow the claim setup at the first time to create the administrator user.

If you use IntelliJ Idea, you can use some run configurations provided with
the project that will make easier to run the application within specific
contexts such as `localdb`, `noclaim` and `dev`.
